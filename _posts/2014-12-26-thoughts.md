Before the end of the year, I have some thoughts about 2014. I discovered the minimalist lifestyle through a Linux blog. That helped me to tidy up my life in a period which I need pretty much. I could see it is the point I had always felt missing. With Anna, we now eat simple and live simply. I also started to run regularly, which allows me to run a half marathon in the end of november. I felt I am living  an important part of my life. 

Somehow, things seem getting more challenging. At work, it is constanly rushing and I get overwhelmed
