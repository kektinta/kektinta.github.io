On my Thinkpad x200s which is a ultrabook without touchpad, I use i3 as my windows manager. i3 ease the use of keyboard to control windows layout. About the touchpad, I intentionnally chose the x200s because the absence of touchpad.

The post is a memo for basic control and configuration of i3.

# Install and configurate i3

* From pacman, use *sudo pacman -S i3"* to install 3 packages related to i3
* It's handy to have dmenu : *sudo pacman -S dmenu"*
* After installation and without personal configurate, call dmenu by mod+d and the terminal by mod+return
* Configurate i3 is simple. It can be done by editing the file *~/.i3/config*

Todos :

* Backup the config file to a github repository

# Use i3

* Create windows, which is equivalent to workspaces, for e.x on xfce : **mod+[1..9]**
* To split a window into panes, use **mod+(v,h)** before calling applications
* i3 proposes three modes for panes layout : **mod+ (e, s, w)

# Shortcuts 
I rematch features and programs that I use the most often. These could be configured inside *.i3/config* 

* Change keyboard layout 
	* Ctr+shift+ 1 : gb
	* Ctr+shift+ 2 : us colemak
* Lauch the terminal : mod + t
* Web browser :  Ctr+ Shift + w : dwb
* Call the dmenu for others applications : mod+d
