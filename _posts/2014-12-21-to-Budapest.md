Our flight is going to land in Budapest next 20 minutes. This end of the year gave me a lot of hussles at job. New organisation, new departures of workmates and new missions. I felt very often exhausted and stressed.

Today, 22nd Dec, after one night in Hungary. I felt pretty better. The job and its preoccupations seem to be far away, both geographically and mentally. Marton & Anna found back eveyone. The family atmosphere is doing us a great good. Today I have time to settle down in my mind and start to write several markdown blog posts about what I have learnt lastly about :

* vim : the great editor that I have been searching for
* tmux : to organise my working session within the terminal 
* bash : some basic knowledge to interact more effectively with Linux

I hope I will have enough occasion to add these posts :

* i3 : light and easy-to-configure windows manager
* git : version control for project, i.e R projects, jekyll blog
* colemak : efficient keyboard layout

That's it for today. I'm very happy to have a break and  to have free time to type blog posts on my x200s. This Thinkpad is a great device with good battery life and wonderful typing confort.
