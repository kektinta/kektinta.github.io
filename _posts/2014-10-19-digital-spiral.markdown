The Internet is everywhere, the only reasonable answer is individual.

[TOC]

# Working with the PC #

## Softwares ##

The main idea is that the PC should stay a modern type-writer. An over-connection will lead into a inefficient state. Hence, the softwares shouldn't be more than 15

**For everyday use**

* Zim : taking notes and journal
* Keepassx : centralize passwords
* Firefox (+ plugins Addblock Edge, Pentadactyl)
* Smplayer (or VLC)
* Grsync

**For photography**

* Shotwell
* Gimp

**For programming**

* Sublime Text 3 : for .md and  .R files
* Git
* Rstudio : for .Rmd
* Pandoc : convert documents

**Note** : Some softwares are not included in the list since I consider these  default softwares of the OS ( mine is a Xfce Manjaro Linux):

* File manager, ex : Thunar 
* Terminal, ex: Terminator or xfce4-terminal

## Configurate the Linux OS ##

* Add shortcuts
* Install Conky

# Photography #

## Some rules of thumb for photo shooting  ##

**Generals rules** :

* Rule of thirds
* Visual mass 
* Contrast

**Portraits**

* Small depth-of-field
* Overhead-cropping
* Rule of thirds
* Look direction 
* Top down (female portraits) or Bottom up


## Post-processing with Gimp ##

 It's all about the moment when the photos are taken. The photo post-processing shouldn't be systematic, but a way to enhance photos.

These are basic operations

* Select area : by figure, lasso or intelligent scissor
* Rescale layers 
* Crop layers
* Add letters
* Colors jobs : 
	- Destaurate (turn image to BW) B
	- Brightness & constrast
* Filter :
	- Blur 
	- Noise
