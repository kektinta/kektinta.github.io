Why the keyboard layout is Qwerty ? It was made such to avoid key tram on mechanic type-writers. Actually, the Qwerty slowed intentionnally to avoid tram. Nowaday, when PC replaced the type-writers, this layout doesn't have any senses any more. Several alternative layout have been created : 

* Dvorak & its French alternative Bépo
* Colemak
* Workman
* Normal

I started to try Bépo. The experience made me feel the Qwerty is wrong ;) Somehow, I encounter some issues

* Shortcut key are hugely effected. Touches z, x, c, v, q, w are moved around too much for me
* It's optimized for French 

I then changed into Colemak. I appreciate these points

* Only 17 touchs are moved. Shortcut are preserved
* Caps lock touch is converted to Back Space, which is much more useful

Colemak layout feel intuitively
