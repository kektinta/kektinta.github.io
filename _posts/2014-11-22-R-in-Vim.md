Today, I succeded to set up a programming environment for R based on Vim and tmux. Here is a log :

Setup Vim-R-plugin : http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/vim-r-plugin.html

The documentation is very well done. Make sure to have the component *clientserver* inside Vim. For this, via pacman, install gvim package instead of vim package. We can still use Vim inside terminal.

When inside tmux, we can read R files by : vim myRfile.R

Then hit ,rf to lauch R terminal. The comma is the local leader defined in .vimrc. Tmux will split into two panes, the R terminal would be inside the bottom part. I want to have it on the right side instead, add this code inside .vimrc : 

``` vim
let g:ScreenImpl = 'Tmux'
"split vertical when hit ,rf
let vimrplugin_vsplit=1
``` 
The last issue, tmux doesn't render correctly vim colorscheme. There is another background behind the code lines, which is different from the general background. The solution is adding this line into the .vimrc file

``` vim
set t_ut=
``` 
If the problem is not solved, hit Ctrl-l inside tmux/vim

When every is set up correctly, it's confortable to program R inside tmux/vim and send code to R terminal by using ,l
